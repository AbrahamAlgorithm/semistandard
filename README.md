### One Semicolon for the Dark Lord on his dark throne

All the goodness of [feross/standard](https://github.com/feross/standard) with semicolons sprinkled on top.

## Install

```bash
npm install semistandard -g
```

## Rules
Importantly:
- **semicolons**
- Check [feross/standard][1] for the rest of the rules.

### What you might do if you're clever

1. Add it to `package.json`

  ```json
  {
    "name": "my-cool-package",
    "devDependencies": {
      "semistandard": "*"
    },
    "scripts": {
      "test": "semistandard && node my-normal-tests-littered-with-semicolons.js"
    }
  }
  ```

2. Check style automatically when you run `npm test`

  ```
  $ npm test
  Error: Code style check failed:
    lib/torrent.js:950:11: Expected '===' and instead saw '=='.
  ```

3. Never give style feedback on a pull request again! (unless its about semicolons)

## FAQ

### Why would I use JavaScript Standard Style?

The beauty of JavaScript Standard Style is that it's simple. No one wants to maintain
multiple hundred-line `.jshintrc` and `.jscs` for every module/project they maintain.
Enough of this madness!

This module saves you time in two ways:

- **No configuration.** Just drop it in. The easiest way to enforce consistent style in
  your module/project.
- **Catch style errors before they're submitted in PRs.** Saves precious code review time
  by eliminating back-and-forth between maintainer and contributor.

### How do I ignore files?

The paths `node_modules/`, `.git/`, `*.min.js`, and `bundle.js` are automatically excluded
when looking for `.js` files to style check.

Sometimes you need to ignore additional folders or specific minfied files. To do that, add
a `standard.ignore` property to `package.json`:

```json
"standard": {
  "ignore": [
    "**/out/**",
    "**/lib/select2/**",
    "**/lib/ckeditor/**"
  ]
}
```

### Is there an automatic formatter?

Yes, try using [Max Ogden](https://github.com/maxogden)'s experimental auto formatter
**[`standard-format`](https://github.com/maxogden/standard-format)** to fix the easier
cases.

### How do I hide a certain warning?

In rare cases, you'll need to break a rule and hide the warning generated by `standard`.

JavaScript Standard Style uses [`jshint`](http://jshint.com/) and
[`jscs`](http://jscs.info/) under-the-hood and you can hide their warnings as you normally
would if you used each linter directly.

To get verbose output (so you can find the particular rule name to ignore), run:

```bash
$ standard --verbose
Error: Code style check failed:
  routes/error.js:20:36: 'next' is defined but never used. (W098)
  routes/submit.js:85:2: Expected indentation of 2 characters (validateIndentation)
```

The first warning is `jshint` (always starts with a `W`). You can hide it with a
`/* jshint -W098 */` comment. Re-enable with a `/* jshint +W098 */` comment.

Example:

```js
/* jshint -W098 */
app.use(function (err, req, res, next) {
  res.render('error', { err: err })
})
/* jshint +W098 */
```

The second warning is from `jscs` (always a long camel-case string), which you can hide
with a `// jscs:disable validateIndentation` comment. Re-enable with a
`// jscs:enable validateIndentation` comment.

### Can you please add more config options?

No. Use `jshint` or `jscs` directly if you want that.

See [feross/standard](1) for more information. In fact, you should probably just use the `standard` module instead.
